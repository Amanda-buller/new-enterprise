  <h1>Behind the Idea </h1>
  <p> Why LamiCare Was Founded

    As a horse owner, I personally experienced the stress and heartbreak of managing a horse with laminitis.
     Every grazing decision felt like a gamble. I was constantly second-guessing myself — 
     unsure whether the paddock was safe, or if the sugar levels were too high. 
     Traditional Brix testing, while valuable, was time-consuming, technical, and hard to maintain regularly.
    
    That's when the idea for LamiCare was born. I didn't just want a tool that could read sugar levels —
     I needed a solution that simplified the entire grazing decision process, reduced risk, and gave peace 
     of mind to horse owners like me..</p>
